This is a child-theme for [Beans](http://www.getbeans.io/)

Theme is still in progress and consists of a lot of hard-coded links and manual customizations.

It is **NOT advised** to use this theme as-is on any other website. However if you are a WordPress developer, you are free to use the code-snippets from this theme into your own theme.

In case you are looking for a ready to use WordPress theme for your Website then check out [TemplateFlip Themes](https://templateflip.com/themes/). It has many other themes built by me which can be easily used and customized on any WordPress website.
